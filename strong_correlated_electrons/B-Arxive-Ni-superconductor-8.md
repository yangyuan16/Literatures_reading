#### Abstract

* find a robust s-wave superconductive (SC) order mediated by interlayer magnetic couplings.
* algebraic pairing correlations with Luttinger parameter  $K_{sc} \approx 1$.   
* iPEPS estimates a strong strength $\bar{\Delta_z} \sim O(0.1)$
* strong interlayer spin exchange (while negligible interlayer hopping)
* strong interlayer spin exchange enhances the SC pairing in the bilayer system



#### Introduction

* optical measurement show that Mott phase
* It is proposed that the strong ferromagnetic (FM) Hund's rule coupling can bind the spins of itinerant dx2-y2 and localized dz2 electrons, which renders a bilayer system consisted of two t-J layers coupled via strong antiferromagnetic (AF) exchange $J_{\bot}$ (by [C. Lu, Z. Pan, F. Yang, and C. Wu, Interlayer coupling driven high-temperature superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 under pressure(2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14965.pdf)),
