## 严格对角化

(1) [HubbardModel2D](https://github.com/ryanlevy/HubbardModel2D) A C++ version of the 2D Hubbard Model with arbitrary lattice. 

(2) [hubbard-dqmc](https://github.com/cmendl/hubbard-dqmc) Determinant quantum Monte Carlo implmentation. 
 C implementation of the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method applied to Hubbard-type models.
 
(3) [Hubbard-GPU](https://github.com/wpoely86/Hubbard-GPU) 
Fermi-Hubbard on the GPU with Cuda. This program can calculate the groundstate energy of 1 dimensional and 
2 dimensional Fermi-Hubard model on the GPU (and CPU). 
It is based on [Exacct diagonalization of the Hubbard model on graphics processing units](https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3425)
by Siro and Harju.

(4) [Qiskit-HubbardModel](https://github.com/kaelynj/Qiskit-HubbardModel) **Hubbard 模型和量子计算结合起来了**
Qiskit code which simulates the time evolution of an excitation in an n site Fermi-Hubbard chain and 
plots the total occupation for each fermionic mode as the system evolves. We make use of a one-dimensional
chain which a much more approachable system to simulate on NISQ devices and simulators. 

**'quantum-simulation.ipybn' contains a WIP derivation of digital quantum simulation, the Trotter-Suzuki formalism,**
**the Fermi-Hubbard model, and the Jordan-Wigner transformation**
