### Survey of researches based on tensor representation of data

#### data source

###### classical data 

* classical models
Ising model, XY model, to produce spin configurations

##### quantum data

* quantum many-body system
quantum Ising model, heisenberg model, to produce ground state, which in tensor form form the data perspective

* quantum circuits
quantum circuits can produce data after measurement

#### methodology

##### using tensor to represent the classical data 
from the two articles 

##### using several statistical methods used in financial filed to studying quantum systems

* Kruskal-Wallis test
* Kolmogorov-Smirnov test

##### using some special machine learning methods to study data

* 异常值检测

##### tensor decomposition

* PARAFAC decomposition
> PARAFAC decomposition represents an extension of the 
bilinear factor analysis to multilinear case. 

>Mathematically, it is based on the idea of rewriting a tensor as the sum of rank-one tensors. PARAFAC decomposition has the advantage to be generally parsimonious and unique. However, this decomposition is 
not flexible and can fail to converge to a solution.
