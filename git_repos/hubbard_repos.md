### Key-Words: Hubbard

#### [hubbardI - A Hubbard-I solver based on triqs atom_diag](https://github.com/TRIQS/hubbardI)

* to solve the generic problem of a **quantum impurity** embedded in a conduction bath for an arbitrary local interaction vertex. The “impurity” can be any set of orbitals, on one or several atoms.
